# Pentatiles
A python implementation of a recursive 2D geometry system for use in games, art and science.

I've created this repository to introduce a system of subdividing space recursively into 5 tile shapes which can be used to create artwork, games or any other use to which a spacial tiling could be of benefit.
I call the system Pentatiles to reflect the five basic tiles in the system; a square, a 'house', a 'barn', a 'crystal' and a 'diamond'.  
There is actually a sixth tile but it too is a square and Sextiles just sounded weird.

Pentatiles have some nice properties such as fixed 45 degree increment aligments and 90 degree or greater interior angles.  
The geometry also can produce paths as distinct entities from boundaries, thus facilitating both walls and halls in human spaces.
Output formats include pseudo weighted Vornoi rendered images as well as an SVG export.

I hope you have fun with Pentatiles!
Thank You,
